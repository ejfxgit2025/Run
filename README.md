 An Endless Runner Game using HTML5,CSS3, VANILLA JavaScript (canvas, sprite animation , parallax backgrounds etc.) 
```

Endless runner or infinite runner is a subgenre of platform game in which the player character runs for an infinite
amount of time while avoiding obstacles. The player's objective is to reach a high score by surviving for as long 
as possible. The method by which the game level or environment appears to continuously spawn before the player
is an example of procedural generation. The genre exploded on mobile platforms following the success of Temple 
Run, with Jetpack Joyride and Canabalt being other popular examples. Its popularity is attributed to its 
simple gameplay that works well on touchscreen devices.
